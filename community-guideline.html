  <h2>Safety and respect for all</h2>
  <p>Motion's Community Guidelines</p>
  <p>Our guidelines were developed to help make every experience feel safe, respectful, and positive.</p>
  <p>Everyone who signs up for an Motion account across all of our apps, including but not limited to drivers, riders, delivery partners, merchants, and businesses using any Motion products, as applicable by jurisdiction, is expected to follow the guidelines. They also apply to interactions with Motion employees and contractors at Greenlight Hubs, through online systems or over the phone.</p>
